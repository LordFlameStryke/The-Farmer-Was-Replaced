This is my code for The Farmer Was Replaced.  I organized all the functions according to their purpose, ie Maze.py is all the code for running mazes, Pumpkins.py is all the code for planting pumpkins, etc.  main.py is the starting point, the file you should run in the game if you download all the files.  The constants for the desierd amounts of items should be changed to reflect your needs in stages.  They can be set based on the unlock requirements if desired.

All the code works on the Dec 21, 2025 release of the game.

I realize I have some unnecessary code that never gets run, it's leftovers from my build process and doesn't affect performance in any way.  I haven't run any leaderboard challenges so I don't know how efficient it is.
